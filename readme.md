DSA Project:-

Hierarchical Clustering for Image Recognition Using KD-Trees

Project Description:

    This project involves implementing a hierarchical clustering algorithm for image recognition tasks. Students will use KD-Trees, a data structure optimized for nearest neighbor search, to efficiently cluster similar images from a large dataset. The primary goal is to group visually similar images together and enable fast retrieval based on visual similarity.

Objectives:
    Understand Image Recognition and Clustering: Learn about image recognition tasks, hierarchical clustering methods, and their applications.

    Learn About KD-Trees: Understand what KD-Trees are, how they work, and why they are useful for nearest neighbor search in multi-dimensional data spaces.

    Implement KD-Trees: Develop a KD-Tree data structure to perform efficient nearest neighbor searches on image feature vectors.

    Design a Clustering Algorithm: Use the KD-Tree to implement a hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups similar images together based on their features.

Project Deliverables:

    KD-Tree Implementation:
        A basic implementation of a KD-Tree that supports:
        Insertion: Adding new image feature vectors.
        Deletion: Removing existing image feature vectors.
        Nearest Neighbor Search: Quickly finding the closest images in the feature space.

    Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm:
        An algorithm that uses the KD-Tree to perform hierarchical clustering, grouping similar images together.

    Dataset of Images:
        A small dataset of images (e.g., 100-200 images) to be used for testing and demonstrating the clustering system.


Expected Learning Outcomes:
    Understand the basics of image recognition and the role of clustering in organizing large datasets.

    Learn about KD-Trees and their applications in efficiently searching high-dimensional data.

    Gain hands-on experience in implementing a hierarchical clustering algorithm for image recognition.
    
    Develop problem-solving skills by applying advanced data structures to real-world tasks.
